The DHTMLX library provides you with the opportunity to create new classes and manipulate them dynamically with the help of the **CssManager** helper.

To make use of the helper you need to initialize the CssManager object with the help of the *dhx.CssManager()* constructor:

~~~js
var cssManager = new dhx.CssManager();
~~~

The list of the available methods of *dhx.CssManager* is described below.
