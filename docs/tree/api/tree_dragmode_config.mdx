<Descr>
 
Drag-n-drop can work in three modes: 

- "target" - a tree takes items from other trees, while its items can't be dragged out of it
- "source" - a tree allows dragging its items out and can't take items from other trees
- "both" - a tree both takes items from other trees and allows dragging its items out as well
