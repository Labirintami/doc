<Descr>
 
Drag-n-drop can work in three modes:

- "target" - a dataview takes items from other dataviews, while its items can't be dragged out of it
- "source" - a dataview allows dragging its items out and can't take items from other dataviews
- "both" - a dataview both takes items from other dataviews and allows dragging its items out as well
