The DHTMLX library provides you with a possibility to use AJAX (Asynchronous Java Script and XML) technique for exchanging data with a web server without reloading the whole page. 

To make AJAX request to a server you can use the following methods of the **dhx.ajax** object:

<div class='h2'>Methods</div>

{{api

- ajax/api/delete.md - sends a DELETE request to the server
- ajax/api/get.md - sends a GET request to the server
- ajax/api/post.md - sends a POST request to the server
- ajax/api/put.md - sends a PUT request to the server

}}
