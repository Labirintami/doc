<Descr>
 
Drag-n-drop can work in three modes: 

- "target" - a list takes items from other lists, while its items can't be dragged out of it
- "source" - a list allows dragging its items out and can't take items from other lists
- "both" - a list both takes items from other lists and allows dragging its items out as well
