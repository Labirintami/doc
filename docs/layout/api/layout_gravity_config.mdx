<Descr>
 
:::note
You can use the <strong>gravity</strong> property only when a cell has no specified sizes - width and height, otherwise - the property does not work.1
::: 

If you specify the property for a cell, its size will be adjusted regarding the sizes of the cells that are in the same row, within the same parent and have <strong>gravity</strong> in their configuration.  

The negative number set as a value to the <strong>gravity</strong> property is equated to zero.

The property is updated in v7.0. For more information, see [Migration article](/migration/index#65270).
