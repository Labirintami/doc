The container control is a very convenient way to develop a form-based solution. You can combine several widgets in one form to make the project functional and easy to use.

Pay attention: you cannot attach the Layout and Form widgets.

You can add the container control to the form in an easy way. All you need is to specify the type of the control `type: "container"` during the initialization of a form and then use one of the methods: `attach` or `attachHTML`. You can also attach the HTML code directly to the container control. See the sample above.

The list of the properties is used to make settings of the container control. For example, the height or width, style, etc. 

You can manipulate the container control by using methods of the object returned by the getItem(form_getitem_method) method. Use methods to hide or show the container, set and get properties, and so on.
