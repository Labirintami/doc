<Descr>
 
Drag-n-drop can work in three modes: 

- "target" - a grid takes rows from other grids, while its rows can't be dragged out of it
- "source" - a grid allows dragging its rows out and can't take rows from other grids
- "both" - a grid both takes rows from other grids and allows dragging its rows out as well
