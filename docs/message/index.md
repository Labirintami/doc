dhtmlxMessage is a tiny but useful component that helps you to interact with a user of your application. Depending on the type of a message, you can inform a user about some processes taking place in the app,
ask for confirmation of some action, warn against some steps that may result in unwanted effects, or simply give a hint about the purpose of a certain element of an app.
Check [online samples for dhtmlxMessage](https://docs.dhtmlx.com/suite/samples/message/).
