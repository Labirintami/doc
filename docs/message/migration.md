### Confirm box

Before v7.0, the *Space* and *Enter* key were used to confirm the Reject button. 
Starting with v7.0, the keys confirm the Apply button. The *Esc* key confirms the Reject button.

Also note, that before v7.0, the confirm buttons were displayed in the following order: "Apply" and "Reject". In the version 7.0, the order has been changed to "Reject" and "Apply".
