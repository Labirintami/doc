The DHTMLX library provides a helper that changes the width and height of the page content based on the window size. 

To create a responsive web page that will be easily adapted to different dimensions of a browser window, make use of the <strong>dhx.resizeHandler</strong> helper:

~~~js
dhx.resizeHandler(container, function (width, height) {
    // some logic here
});
~~~

The helper takes two parameters:

- <strong>container</strong> - an HTML element where the handler function is added to
- <strong>handler</strong> - (*function*) a callback function that returns the container width and height after its sizes were changed
