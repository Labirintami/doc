This is a button with an image. Unlike sidebar/button.md, it does not have a text label, but cal also have a badge with a number and can be two state.



## Adding ImageButton

ImageButton can be easily added to a sidebar with the help of the <strong>add()</strong> method of Tree Collection:

~~~js
sidebar.data.add({
    type: "imageButton",
    count: 10,
    src: "../img/avatar.png"
});
~~~
